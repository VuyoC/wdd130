        <p>Hi! My name is Vuyo Chemese. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am a big rugby and football fan. I love playing football and rugby, and spending time with my family and friends. I am married and I have one son. I took this course becasue it teaches skills that are not common. I want to learn a skill that is rare and use it to take care of my family. My favorite temple are the Johannesburg Temple because it is the first temple I ever entered.</p>

      <p>South Africa is a country with a lot of diversity. The diversity is sometimes a source of contention but when we work together it is beautiful. There's a lot of beauty and there are many reasons we can be proud to call this place our home.</p>
